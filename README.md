🌦️ Weather App
I’m excited to share my latest project, a Weather App that delivers real-time weather updates alongside a visually dynamic interface. This app is designed to provide a seamless and engaging user experience, combining live data with an adaptive design.

🚀 Key Features
Real-time Weather Data: Powered by the OpenWeatherMap API, the app fetches up-to-date weather information for any city.
Dynamic Backgrounds: Visuals change based on the weather in the selected location, using beautiful images from the Pixabay API.
Interactive UI: Enjoy a responsive, animated interface with smooth hover effects.
City Search: Quickly search for any city worldwide and view instant weather details.
🔧 Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
APIs: Integrated with OpenWeatherMap for live weather data and Pixabay for background images.

Would love to hear your feedback and thoughts! 💬
